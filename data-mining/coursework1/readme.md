### I used k-means clustering method to cluster the dataset. 

### Code instructionsï¼š

+ The implementation of k-means algorithm is in the [k_means.py](k_means.py).
+ The implementation of Gaussian mixture model is the the [gmm.py](gmm.py).
+ [utils.py](utils.py) contains some useful functions.
+ The main procedure for solving this clustering problem is in the [main.ipynb](main.ipynb). Just run this code sequentially.

###### I also tried Agglomerative hierarchical clustering, but I found the hierarchical clustering is really slow and memory-consuming when fitting this dataset. It doesn't work well in this dataset.
